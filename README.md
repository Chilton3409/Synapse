This is a virtual assistant project built using Python and various AI/ML libraries. 
The assistant uses speech recognition to understand user input and responds accordingly.


Features
- Speech Recognition: Uses Vosk speech recognition library to transcribe user audio input.
- Natural Language Processing: Uses Meta AI API to process and understand user input.
- Text-to-Speech: Uses PyTTSX3 library to convert text responses to audio.
- Audio Processing: Applies bandpass filter to remove noise from audio input.

Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Vosk speech recognition library
- Meta AI API token
- PyTTSX3 library
- PyAudio library
- NumPy library
- SciPy library

1. Install the required libraries using pip.
2. Set the META_AI_TOKEN environment variable to your Meta AI API token.
